any reason to query by deck without user? not really
any reason to query by deckname without deck, maybe?
any reason to query by cards

app/server stuff
    Builder
        transactions
            post completed deck to database, possibly to a user
            get card info from db, put into "completed deck"
            get card names for autocomplete/verification

_____________________________________________________________________________

Think practically about backend. If something needs to be stitched together, do it client side.
Each Deck should ideally be 60 unique objects, makes them much easier to manipulate.
Iterate over objects, pull names, add names to array.
4 Arrays, one for each zone. Push/pop items from arrays to shift cards.
Create 60 variables, one for each card? (Easiest to manipulate)

If I need to get card name data, querying based on what's in client side JS, how do I do that?

//db.cards.createIndex({name: "text"})

//db.cards.find({$text: {$search: "\"SEARCHQUERY\""}});

//collection.find({$text: {$search: "\"" + queryInput + "\""}}).toArray((err, docs)

deckCompiler("http://localhost:3000/builder", numberOfCard, { cardname: nameOfCard })

keypress enter add card
sidebar = list of decks, onclick load deck from db into currentDeck
    reload button
add "PLEASE VALIDATE DECKLIST"
